&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living as I do on the academic treadmill, I spend a lot of my time writing grant applications.
The major funding agency in Australia for non-medical research is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.arc.gov.au"&gt;Australian Research Council&lt;/a&gt;,
so I often regularly to update my academic publication list according to their requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all publications over the past 10 years (can vary depending on the scheme or round)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate them into journal papers, books, book chapters, conference proceedings etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put a star next to the ones which are relevant to the particular project proposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use 12 point font with minimum 0.5cm margins all around the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Past grants awarded need to be listed, along with the papers that report their outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a requirement, but most people like to underline their own name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formatting instructions are apparently taken quite seriously, with grant applications having
been ruled ineligible for violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="current-state-of-the-art"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current &amp;quot;state of the art&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my colleagues have an MS Word document listing all their publications, which they update
for each round. I originally did this too, but I find it rather unappealing for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's a nuisance to manually format all bibliography entries to be consistent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually updating can easily lead to missed or duplicate entries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For numbered style bibliographies, the publications belonging to each grant need
to be changed every time a paper is added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes Word introduces seemingly random font and style changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of years of publication history required sometimes changes between schemes and rounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I much prefer the quality of typesetting produced by LaTeX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The publication list is essentially a database, and I find something philosophically wrong with
using MS Word as a database tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was to create a LaTeX class and template which generates the document in
a fairly automated manner. By keeping my publication database up to date in reference
management software (which I do anyway), I can generate and update the required document fairly easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I organise the PDFs of my collection of papers with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.zotero.org"&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source
cross platform tool to manage your papers. It's along a similar vein to EndNote and Mendeley,
so this solution should be adaptable by users of those programs. I keep my own
publications in a collection, so they are easy to find and export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Make sure that each publication has the correct Item Type for a journal article, book chapter etc.
This will ensure it gets listed under the appropriate category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Ensure that each bibliography entry has a fixed BibTeX key, that doesn't change if your
library changes. In Zotero, the best way to do this is with the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://zotplus.github.io/better-bibtex/"&gt;Better BibTex&lt;/a&gt; plugin. Select all the entries,
right click, and in the menu select &amp;quot;Generate BibTeX key&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Export the entries to BibLaTeX format (BibTeX format should be okay too) using the
Better BibLaTeX exporter in Zotero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Download the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;arcpubs&lt;/tt&gt; LaTeX &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/DavidPowell/arcpubs/archive/master.zip"&gt;class and template&lt;/a&gt;.
Rename &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;example.tex&lt;/tt&gt; to something else if you want, then open it in your favourite LaTeX editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The required changes to this file are fairly straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;\addbibresource&lt;/tt&gt; line to the name of your &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.bib&lt;/tt&gt; file. You can
have multiple calls if you need more than one file to be included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;\StartYear&lt;/tt&gt; command indicates that only publications from this year or
later will be included&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;\Author&lt;/tt&gt; command should contain your surname, for the purposes of underlining it.
Any publications not containing that name will be excluded from the list, so if you
have a .bib file for your whole research group, your publications will be extracted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;\addtocategory{relevant}&lt;/tt&gt; gives the BibTeX keys of all publications relevant to this
proposal, which will be starred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the table at the bottom of the page, list existing ARC grants, and &lt;cite&gt;cite&lt;/cite&gt; any papers
relevant to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Compile the latex file to generate the pdf. Note that instead of BibTeX, BibLaTeX is used,
because I needs its powerful features for filtering by year, category. Assuming you didn't
rename the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; file, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
pdflatex example
biber example
pdflatex example
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything went smoothly, then you should have nice PDF output with the first page looking something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="PDF Output" src="images/pubs_page_1.png" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I admit that's a lot of steps for a supposedly automated process, but after you've done it once
it's quite quick and easy to keep it up to date. I expect that it could also be quite useful for
anyone else trying to keep their academic CV up to date, even if they don't care about the particular
requirements of the ARC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tips-and-potential-problems"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips and potential problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most windows users will have installed LaTeX using the MiKTeX distribution. Unfortunately the
64 bit version of MikTex is missing the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;biber&lt;/tt&gt; command. However, the 32 bit version can be downloaded,
and will work just fine. See these &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/63048"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is necessary to check carefully over the document just to make sure that text hasn't run
outside the margins, which occasionally happens when LaTeX cannot hyphenate long words or URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlining of author name and selection of which entries to include is based on the surname,
so you may get strange results if one of your co-authors has the same surname.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
